## Getting Started
First, we need to install our dependencies with:

```bash
./install.sh
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
./run.sh
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Tabs

### Home

This is the base functionality of the Focus-Peaking app to view the focus peaking of the sample video.

### Webcam

This is your cam with Focus-peaking added.

## Approach
For this project, I used NextJs as my React Framework and dabbled with shadcdn for components.

For Focus peaking, I didn't have much experience with this concept. I did a bit of research, and found an interesting algorithm for this, which is the Sobel algorithm: https://paulbourke.net/miscellaneous/focuspeaking/
